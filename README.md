## Requirements 

* NodeJS version 11 or higher

### After downloading

To be able to execute the code, we must follow these steps:

* Verify if we have NodeJS installed and validate that the version is equal to or greater than 11
  * Using the command in CMD or a terminal for validate the version: `node -v` or `node --version`
* If it's not installed or its version is greater than 11
  * We go to the official [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)website, it is recommended to choose the LTS version. Depending on the operating system, make the selection.
* In CMD or a terminal, navigate to the directory where the code file "main.js" is located
  * Execute the command `node main.js`
